# Claim severity modeling with tree-based machine learning methods

This document is a supplementary material that accompanies our research paper on *Boosting insights in insurance tariff plans with tree-based machine learning*, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10890). In the paper, the results obtained with tree-based machine learning methods for claim frequencies are extensively discussed. This document provides the results for the claim severities regarding both model building and model interpretation.
